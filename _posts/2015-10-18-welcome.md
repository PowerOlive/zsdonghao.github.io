I am a second year computer science student in Jacobs University,
Bremen. I have been part of [KWARC](https://kwarc.info) group developing sTeX since
January, 2015. During my free time, I like to know more about data
science and play sports.

Since my old website's domain is going to expire soon, I think it
would be a good idea to migrate to Github's personal page. I will try
to write more on a regular basis in the future.
